** Story **

Once up on a time, there lived a Monkey in the forest. It lived on a tree
which is on the bank of a river.

One day a crocodile came to rest under the shade of the same tree.
The kindhearted Monkey gave crocodile an apple to eat. It tasted so yummy 
to the crocodile.

The crocodile used to visit the monkey daily and sooner they became good friends.
